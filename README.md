# Autoencoder in Pytorch

In this repository there are a series of Computer Vision related projects which use AutoEncoder type arhitectures.

## Image Denosing 

Demo project that denoises an image in 2 steps. 

1. Pretraining - training the AE to reconstruct MNIST digits.
2. With the decoder fix, the encoder is trained to match the latent space of a clean image
